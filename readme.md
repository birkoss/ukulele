- New page with quiz asking to finger the correct chord depending on a chord name and type

- New page allowing us to finger the fret and it will show the chord name (if possible)

- Favorites list (Allow the addition of multiple chords from different types) for a quick bookmark
  - Tabs: Chords, Favorites (maybe settings)

- Find a better way to show the muted string such as Dbm (the A string)
